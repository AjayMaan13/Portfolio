- Create cursor effects (optional)
- Add subtle feedback animations for user actions

## Phase 4: Performance & Polish (Week 5)

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- Optimize image loading (WebP format, lazy loading)
- Implement code splitting for JavaScript
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize animations for performance
- Test and optimize load times

### 4.2 Accessibility Improvements
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for both themes
- Add ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

### 4.3 Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Fix any browser-specific issues
- Ensure consistent experience across platforms
- Test on different devices and screen sizes

## Phase 5: Backend Integration & Deployment (Week 6)
